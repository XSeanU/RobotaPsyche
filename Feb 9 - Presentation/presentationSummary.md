## Overview

My individual presentation is entitled "Power of the Mass", in which

- I have introduced a concept called "complex system" which is inspired by biological phenomena in the nature and widely employed in today's society.
- The topic ties strongly with this course, especially the parts that experiment on the emerging behavior rooted out of simple reflexes with Processing.
- At the end of the presentation, I included a section for further discussion about the ethics in the utilization of complex system.

## Preparation

In the preparation of the presentation, I have consulted several sources including *Complexity*, *The Machine Question*, etc. After comprehensive research and outlining, I have made some slides for the class. The entire archive can be viewd via [this link](/Feb%209%20-%20Presentation).

## Structure

- I drew the concept of complex system from the example of an ant colony, and compared it with a human neural network, both of which are especially weak and blind at the individual level yet super coherent, emergent, and powerful at the higher levels.
- After that, I concluded three main characteristics of the complex system and its link to reductionism, and stressed its importance by linking the concept with the real-life instances.
- Finally, in the further discussion, I have introduced Gunkel's agent-patient question on machine morality, as well as the unredictable results in dynamic systems theory in the case of many complex systems.

## Outcomes

The presentation incited thoughts of my peers, including

 - The (un)predictability of a system when it incorporates more components, even simple ones with preset behavior/mechanisms, because chaos will be produced at the macroscopic level.
 - Whether machines have the legitimacy to claim to certain rights as a "moral patient".
 - The intelligence a machine has to achieve to be considerd a "moral agent", and to be held responsible and accountable.
 - The interchangeable nature of the agent-patient relationship between humans and machines.
