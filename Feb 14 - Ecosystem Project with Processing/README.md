### Description

This project, as an assignment, is required to simulate an ecosystem in Processing. It incorporates the concepts we have learned from the book *Vehicles*.

The ecosystem I tried to build consists of a group of insects (possibly fireflies) of different brightness displayed in a black & white gradient. Each insect has a different initial velocity. The insects are designed to be attracted to

- each other;

- bright yellow light sources placed by the user by mouse clicks.

The insects obey Newton's first law of inertia, that they would not change their velocities (direction & magnitude) immediately when attracted. Instead, their velocities change due to the forces exerted by the attraction, according to Newton's second law. Additionally, they turn back after colliding with the wall.

### Takeaways

After trials and failures, I am now more acquainted with programming in Java environment, especially in:

- the use of punctuation marks in this language;
- ArrayList;
- initiation of objects;
- global and local variables.

Also, I observed that with some rather simple principles, the entire system seems to be chaos, which is unpredictable. I am more convinced that the entire world may be set alive in the innate simplicity and observed unpredictability.



### Room for improvement

As demonstrated in the end of the video, after placing more than five light sources in the ecosystem, the rather simple program can easily occupy high computing resources of the system. Nonetheless, while occupying such resources, the program is still not able to run smoothly. The program thus needs to be optimized.
