## Description

This project, as an midterm assignment, is to simulate an ecosystem in Processing. It incorporates the concepts we have learned from the book *Vehicles*, and is the continuation and complication of the previous ecosystem.

The ecosystem I tried to build consists of a group of insects. Each insect has a different initial velocity represented by the gradient. The insects are designed to be attracted to each other AND the bright yellow light sources placed by the user by mouse clicks.

In the dark mode:

- the insect only moves when it is stimulated by the movement of neighboring insects
- the light source is highly attracting

In the day mode:

- the insect moves spontaneously closer to other insects in the group
- 

The insects obey Newton's first law of inertia, that they would not change their velocities (direction & magnitude) immediately when attracted. Instead, their velocities change due to the forces exerted by the attraction, according to Newton's second law. Additionally, they turn back after colliding with the wall.



observation

like other insects such as mostquitos

we cannot find them except that we have something appeling to them

## Retrospection

I have made a roadmap of what to achieve after drafting possible features:

- [x] variation in insect properties represented by the gradient;
- [x] day and night modes with two different sets of fireflies behavior;
- [x] a different mechanism of the wall/edges;
- [x] instructions on the screen.

More detailed description of what I have done in the process of development is included in 

After trials and failures, I am now more acquainted with programming in Java environment, especially in:

- the use of punctuation marks in Java language;
- ArrayList;
- initiation of objects;
- global and local variables.

Also, I observed that with some rather simple principles, the entire system seems to be chaos, which is unpredictable. I am more convinced that the entire world may be set alive in the innate simplicity and observed unpredictability.

As demonstrated in the end of the video, after placing more than three light sources in the ecosystem, the rather simple program can easily occupy high computing resources of the system. Nonetheless, while occupying such resources, the program is still not able to run smoothly. The program thus needs to be optimized.
