I tried to apply other approaches too implement the fading trail, yet it does not resolve the issue of lagging - it appears that some other calculations occupy many resources as well. I decide to remove the trial functionality, and limit the maximum amount of light sources.

Possible ideas to be implemented:

- day and night modes with two different sets of fireflies behavior
- legends indicating the properties of insects and current environment
- a variable flow field controlled by the keyboard
- fire that can kill the insects
