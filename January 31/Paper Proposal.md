## Proposed Topic 1: How do robots remove barriers for human

The paper will be a comprehensive review of disparate roles robots play in personal and industrial dimensions. 

One area will represent one section in the paper. In each section, the differences robots are making compared to previous times, in terms of investment, employment, lifestyles, etc. will be explored, and then mechanisms in which how robots are created to make the differences will be studied. In the end of the paper, the prospects of cybernetics will be discussed, providing a vision to the future.

Examples of the sections include:

1. Translation robots
2. Creative writing robots
3. Visual AI
4. Factory assembling robots
5. Personal health monitoring devices and algorithms



## Proposed Topic 2: Mechanism and Impact of semantic robots in intra- and cross-cultural communications

The paper will discuss how language is recognized and assembled by robots by drawing inferences from language structures in English and Chinese. Extracting the meaning and transforming it into machine language are the basic steps involved in machine-facilitated communications. The flow of information that exists within and across cultures is analyzed, especially when it is promoted by semantic robots. Other topics such as equity and recreation in translation might also be discussed.

A abstract structure of the paper includes:

1. Mechanisms of language recognition and assembly in machines
2. Roles of machine-facilitated communications in cultures
3. Discussion on the ethics of machine engagement in language

## Proposed Topic 3: Power of the mass

An ant can carry out simple actions only. It is particularly weak in nature. But what if there are hundreds of, thousands of, or even millions of such ants? The paper will explore how machines imitate the natural phenomenon of massive movement, in which there are random trials, failures, reproduction, and eventually prediction. The interactions among individuals, which serve a vital role in the dynamics will be examined in detail.

## Random thoughts

- Accountability of AI. Bringing the hazards of Tesla in, I will discuss in circumstances that AI make mistakes who is held accountable and how will the victims be compensated.
