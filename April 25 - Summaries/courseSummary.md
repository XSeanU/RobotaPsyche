If I am to use three words to describe this course, and my experiences in this course, it would be:

- multidisciplinary

  This course has been a vision-broadening experience for me, as it incorporates elements ranging from philosophy to cybernetics.

- enriching

- engaging

  Every student, including each one of my peers and myself, has been actively participated in the class and contributed to the overall discussion. The professor provides an extremely open atmosphere where one is welcomed to share their thoughts and receive feedback.
