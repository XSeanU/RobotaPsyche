## Overview

My individual presentation is entitled "Power of the Mass", in which

- I have introduced a concept called "complex system" which is inspired by biological phenomena in the nature and widely employed in today's society.
- The topic ties strongly with this course, especially the parts that experiment on the emerging behavior rooted out of simple reflexes with Processing.
- At the end of the presentation, I included a section for further discussion about the ethics in the utilization of complex system.

# Preparation
In the preparation of the presentation, I have consulted several sources including *Complexity*, *The Machine Question*, etc. After comprehensive research and outlining, I have made some slides for the class.
